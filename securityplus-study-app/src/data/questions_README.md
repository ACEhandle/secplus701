# Practice Test Question/Answer Requirements

This document defines the requirements and best practices for authoring and reviewing practice test questions and answers for this app. These rules are designed to ensure clarity, fairness, and extensibility for any certification or subject area.

## General Requirements
- **Unambiguous Questions:** Each question must have only one clearly correct answer. Distractors (incorrect options) must be valid terms from the subject area, but should not be plausible as correct answers for the specific question.
- **Acronym Usage:**
  - If an acronym is used in a question, answer, or distractor, it must NOT be defined or spelled out in the question, answer, or distractor itself. (e.g., use "SIEM" not "Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)").
  - The explanation field (shown during review) MUST include the full definition/expansion of any acronym used in the question or answer, to reinforce learning.
  - This rule applies to all acronyms found in the glossary or relevant to the subject area.
- **Parentheticals:** Do not use parenthetical definitions (e.g., "(PKI)", "(EDR)") in questions, answers, or distractors. Use only the acronym or the full term, not both together.
- **Explanations:**
  - The explanation field must clearly state why the correct answer is correct and why the distractors are incorrect.
  - If an acronym is used, the explanation must include its full definition.
- **Distractor Quality:** Distractors must be real, relevant terms from the subject area, but not plausible as the correct answer for the specific question.
- **No Double Negatives:** Avoid double negatives or confusing phrasing in questions and answers.
- **No Overlapping Answers:** Do not use answers or distractors that overlap in meaning or could both be considered correct.
- **No Certification-Specific Language:** Do not reference specific exam names, numbers, or organizations in the question/answer text unless absolutely necessary for context.
- **Extensibility:** These rules apply to all practice test modules.

## Example (Acronym Rule)
- **Bad:**
  - Q: What is the main function of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?
  - A: To manage digital certificates
- **Good:**
  - Q: What is the main function of a PKI?
  - A: To manage digital certificates
  - Explanation: PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is a framework for managing, distributing, and verifying digital certificates for secure communications.
